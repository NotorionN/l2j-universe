<body>Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
I see you've chosen strong allies. This battle will be fierce, and if you see me go down, do not hesitate to run. We
can't afford to lose any more people, and If that happens, you will need time to regroup. Now, I hope you`re ready to
take this fight to the enemy, because we're going into their base.<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest _10343_DayOfDestinyDarkElfsFate start_instance">I`m ready.</a>
