You should be aware of the forbidden gates on the outpost of Aden. Goddess of Destruction to bring them to his
attention, because now the place is filled with dark energy. And new Shilen terrible monsters waiting for an opportunity
to attack Aden.<br>
Our brave vanguard of Aden found in the dungeon lair of evil creatures and tried to destroy it. Braves were missing and
now it is not clear whether they were alive or dead. We were just about to send a scouting party to them to help. It
would be good that you take up the matter.<br>
