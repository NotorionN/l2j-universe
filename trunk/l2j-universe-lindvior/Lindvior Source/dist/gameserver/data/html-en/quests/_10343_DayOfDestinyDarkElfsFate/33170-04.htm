<body>Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
Oltran gave me this ring, and I've been holding onto it for someone worthy. Now I've seen you in action, I think you
should borrow it for the coming fight.<br>
It Is sealed with magical powers which pass to the wearer, allowing them to draw on power that they will some day come
to possess.<br>
If you're ready, let`s defeat those monsters.
