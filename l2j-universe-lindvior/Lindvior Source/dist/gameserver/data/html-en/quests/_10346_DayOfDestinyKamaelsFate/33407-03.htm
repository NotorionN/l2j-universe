Th... these are the mementos from our fallen brethren?... Nor no, I'm fine. Just a bit of dust in my eye. Huhmmm. Thank
you. The families and friends of the fallen will always remember you for bringing them these tokens of their loved ones.<br>
If you're still up for a task, I'd appreciate it if you'd go check on Captain Adolph and his men. They headed into the
Evil Incubator ages ago and we haven`t heard from them since. They're probably just fine, but if they're in over their
heads I couldn't live with myself if I failed to send in reinforcements.<br>
